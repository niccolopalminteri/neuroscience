Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a neurostimulation treatment employed to control motor symptoms characteristic of movement disorders. Stimulation of the anterior thalamic nucleus (ANT) obtained a conformité européenne (CE) certification in Europe, as well as approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. This work aims to quantify via a meta-analysis the effectiveness of DBS in the treatment of epilepsy. A PICO framework-guided systematic review of randomized controlled trials and open-label studies forms the basis of this analysis, incorporating a critical qualitative examination to dissect variation in study designs and outcomes. The investigation is also supplemented by subgroup meta-analyses to enhance the robustness of conclusions. Such research contributes a novel meta-analytical approach, combining time-based evaluations and multiple methods for outcome reporting.
